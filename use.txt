Copy myregrw and myregrw.ko somewhere (e.g. /myregrw). 

In that folder, run
insmod myregrw.ko

It will say:
I was assigned major number #number#.

Type:
mknod ./regrw c #number# 0

Create a read control file, which should contain a line in the format
0x<address to read> 1

Then, you can run
./myregrw <read control file> <data file> read

When you're done collecting data, press CTRL-c
